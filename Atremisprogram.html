        <p>Artemis represents a new era of human space exploration, building upon the legacy of the Apollo program while embracing the latest advancements in technology, science, and international collaboration. Our mission is to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon, conducting groundbreaking research, testing new technologies, and preparing for future missions to Mars and beyond.</p>
        <h3 style="color: rgba(209, 15, 15, 0.679);">Goals and Objectives:</h3>
        <p>Return to the Moon: Artemis will return humans to the lunar surface for the first time since the Apollo missions, with the goal of landing the first woman and the next man on the Moon by the mid-2020s.
            Sustainable Exploration: Artemis aims to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon, leveraging lunar resources to support long-duration missions and laying the groundwork for future exploration of Mars and beyond.
            International Collaboration: Artemis is an international effort, bringing together NASA, international partners, and commercial companies to achieve shared goals in space exploration, scientific research, and technological innovation.
            Inspiration and Education: Artemis seeks to inspire the next generation of explorers, scientists, and innovators, fostering curiosity, creativity, and collaboration while engaging people around the world in the excitement of space exploration.</p>
        <h4 style="color: rgba(209, 15, 15, 0.679);">Key Components:</h4>
