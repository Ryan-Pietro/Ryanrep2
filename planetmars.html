<p>Mars has long captivated our imagination as the next frontier for human exploration. At NASA,  <br>we're committed to making that dream a reality. Our mission to Mars encompasses a series of robotic missions to study the planet's atmosphere, geology, and potential for life, as well as preparations for crewed missions in the future.</p>
<h3 style="color: brown;">Current missions</h3>
<p>Mars Perseverance Rover: Explore the latest mission to Mars with the Perseverance Rover, which landed on the Martian surface in February 2021.  <br>Perseverance is searching for signs of past microbial life, collecting samples for future return to Earth, and testing technologies for future human exploration.</p>
